# Left 2 Die, Arcade Game in StarCraft II

## Prologue

Left 2 Die is an Arcade Mini-game, made by Blizzard, in StarCraft II (also made by Blizzard). A typical game will take around 5 mins if you suck, or up to 70 mins if you kick ass as a duo. Playing solo, if you're great, you'll probably last no longer than ~30 mins.

You can find this game by going to the `ARCADE` tab, and searching for "Left 2 Die" by Blizzard.

## Solo vs. Duo

### Solo

*	Supply cap is 200 supply.
*	Two command centers: you control both.
*	You alone accumulate and spend biomass.

### Duo

*	Supply cap is 200 supply for each individual (so in total, the two of you combined can have `200+200=400`).
*	Two command centers: each player controls one. The user who created the room will be in control of the southeast base. The second player will control the southwest base.
*	Both players accumulate biomass (generally distributed evenly). Resource trading is enabled later in the game (probably at around ~15 mins?).

## Important Event Times

Here is an exhaustive list of all notable events for the first 25 mins. If you are prepared for all of them, you can last well beyond 30 mins.

| Survival Time 	| Description of event 	|
|---	|---	|
| 4:07 | (2p) You should have enough to buy Omnisteel Bunkers for 50 biomass. |
| 8:20 | Hunterlings appear behind the mineral line. You'll need some form of defense (some units or a planetary fortress, ideally both) |
| 10:47 | Enemy breaks through the obstructive terrain on north side. You'll want to have setup defense for this already. |
| 11:33 | Spotters appear behind the mineral line. Build missle turrets at every chokepoint and behind your mineral line. You shouldn't need to spend valuable supply on this, because missle turrets cost minerals (which is sustainable, unlike gas) to build and repair. |
| 15:40 | Chokers will appear. You probably want tanks at every chokepoint, or else they might attack from a safe range (they have 8 range). |
| 16:33 | Enemy breakthrough on south side. You'll want to have setup defense for this already. |
| ~20:00 | Nydus worm appears, probably near the middle of your base. You need to kill it ASAP because it'll keep pulsing out unlimited units otherwise. If you cannot quickly kill a Nydus worm, you are **guaranteed** to lose soon after. |
| ~23:00 | Stank comes. You can send a stimmed Marauder to run close to, but not touching, Stank. Stank will follow the nearest unit. The Marauder could run in a zigzag fashion past the range of your tanks, which can whittle down Stank's armored carapace. |
| ~25:00 | Another Nydus. |
