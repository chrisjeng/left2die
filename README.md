## Important Event Times.

|---	|---	|
| 8:20 | Hunterlings appear behind the mineral line |
| 10:47 | Breakthrough on north side. |
| 11:33 | Spotters appear behind the mineral line. Build missle turrets at every chokepoint and behind your mineral line, or if you really can't, get some goliaths. |
| 15:40 | Chokers will appear. You probably want tanks. If you bought goliaths already, you might be too poor. |
| 16:33 | Breakthrough on south side. |
| 20:00 | Nydus worm appears, probably near the middle of your base. You need to kill it ASAP because it'll keep pulsing  out unlimited units otherwise. |
