## Important Event Times

| Survival Time 	| Description of event 	|
|---	|---	|
| 8:20 | Hunterlings appear behind the mineral line. |
| 10:47 | Enemy breakthrough on north side. |
| 11:33 | Spotters appear behind the mineral line. Build missle turrets at every chokepoint and behind your mineral line, or if you really can't, have a bunch of marines (marines in bunkers is not good enough). |
| 15:40 | Chokers will appear. You probably want tanks at every chokepoint. |
| 16:33 | Enemy breakthrough on south side. |
| ~20:00 | Nydus worm appears, probably near the middle of your base. You need to kill it ASAP because it'll keep pulsing out unlimited units otherwise. |
| ~25:00 | Another Nydus. |
